/// [Luminous intensity][wp-luminous-intensity] is a measure of the amount of
/// light produced ([luminous flux](LuminousFlux)) per unit [solid
/// angle](SolidAngle).
/// Consider a light bulb that emits light in all directions and a spotlight that
/// only emits light in a cone. If both lights had the same luminous flux (same
/// total amount of light produced), then the spotlight would have higher luminous
/// intensity since its light is concentrated into a smaller solid angle (and the
/// light from the spotlight would appear brighter if viewed from the same
/// distance).
/// On the other hand, if both lights had the same luminous intensity, then they
/// would appear equally bright when viewed from the same distance (something lit by
/// the spotlight would appear equally bright as the same object lit by the light
/// bulb) but the spotlight would have lower luminous flux since its light covers a
/// smaller solid angle.
/// Luminous intensity is measured in [candelas][wp-candelas].
