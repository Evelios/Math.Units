/// A <c>LuminousFlux</c> value represents the total amount of light emitted by a

/// <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_flux">it's a bit more complicated than that</a>.
/// Luminous flux is stored in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(unit)">lumens</a>. It's often used to describe the
/// total output of a light bulb; for example, a 50 watt incandescent bulb and a 6
/// watt LED bulb might each have an output of 400 lumens.
