/// A static class providing added features to the floating point number class.
/// The main features of this class allow for better floating point equality
/// testing. Generally, floating points always have small variations in their
/// values because the way that floating point numbers are encoded. It is often
/// useful to do equality comparison checks between floating point numbers in a
/// variety of contexts. There are two main ways of doing this type of
/// comparison. The first is to use a percentage tolerance between two numbers,
/// eg. Two floating point numbers are equal if they are within 0.01% of each
/// other. Another is to compare if the two numbers are within an absolute range
/// from each other, eg. Two floating point numbers are equal if they are within
/// 0.0001 units of each other.
///
/// This library does comparison by absolute value comparison through digit
/// precision. Numbers are considered equal if they are equal when rounded to
/// the number of digits as specified by `Float.DigitPrecision`. The default is
/// 10 digits, so by default `2.0 = 2.00000000003` (the 11th digit is a 3).
///
/// `Float.Epsilon` is a derived value from the number of digits and represents
/// the maximum difference between two numbers that is considered equal. This
/// number is `10^-DigitPrecision` which by default is `10^(-10)`, or
/// `0.000000001`.
///
/// In general the rules followed by this extension are from [The Floating Point
/// Guide on Comparison](https://floating-point-gui.de/errors/comparison/).
